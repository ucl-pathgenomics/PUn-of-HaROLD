High level plan

# input
a set of bam files
    if a .txt file list if given with samples in order it will use that, else it will create one
reference.fasta
v_max number of haplotypes to test



#harold process
lets just take the bam/same files and send them to readcount, dont take the users strandcount





#refinement process
requires
    bam file for sample
    lld - same basis set for all samples
    reference.fasta
    fasta sequences not required - not benefit to providing
#takes each sample in turn and refines each independantly
